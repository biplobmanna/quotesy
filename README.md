# Quotesy

Trying a quotes showing app using django and HTMX.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

Backend using Django.

### Frontend

Frontend using HTMX.

## UI

The UI is a simple UI showing a list of quotes added in the DB ordered by last added/modified date.

There is a quote adder at the bottom which can be used to add more quote. On adding a new quote, the new created data is prepended to the list of already existing quotes.

All CRUD operations are performed using HTMX triggers.

The CSS is done using TailwindCSS.

## !! NOTE !!

This is mostly to play around with HTMX and have some fun.
